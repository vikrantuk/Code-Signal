'''
Note: Try to solve this task in O(n) time using O(1) additional space, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a singly linked list of integers, determine whether or not it's a palindrome.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list

Example

For l = [0, 1, 0], the output should be
isListPalindrome(l) = true;

For l = [1, 2, 2, 3], the output should be
isListPalindrome(l) = false.
